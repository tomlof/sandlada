"""
The :mod:`sandlada.multiblock.algorithms` module includes several projection
based latent variable algorithms.

These algorithms all have in common that they maximise a criteria on the form

    f(w_1, ..., w_n) = \sum_{i,j=1}^n c_{i,j} g(cov(X_iw_i, X_jw_j)),

with possibly very different constraints put on the weights w_i or on the
scores t_i = X_iw_i (e.g. unit 2-norm of weights, unit variance of scores,
L1/LASSO constraint on the weights etc.).

This includes methods such as PCA (f(p) = cov(Xp, Xp)),
PLS-R (f(w, c) = cov(Xw, Yc)), PLS-PM (the criteria above), RGCCA (the
criteria above), etc.

    """Inner loop of the NIPALS algorithm.

    Performs the NIPALS algorithm on the supplied tuple or list of numpy
    arrays in X. This method applies for 1, 2 or more blocks.

    One block would result in e.g. PCA; two blocks would result in e.g.
    SVD or CCA; and multiblock (n > 2) would be for instance GCCA,
    PLS-PM or MAXDIFF.

    This function uses Wold's procedure (based on Gauss-Siedel iteration)
    for fast convergence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X          : A tuple or list with n numpy arrays of shape [M, N_i],
                 i=1,...,n. These are the training set.

    adj_matrix          : Adjacency matrix that is a numpy array of shape [n, n].
                 If an element in position adj_matrix[i,j] is 1, then block i and
                 j are connected, and 0 otherwise. If adj_matrix is None, then all
                 matrices are assumed to be connected.

    mode       : A tuple or list with n elements with the mode to use for
                 a matrix. The mode is represented by a string: "A", "B"
                 or "NewA". If mode = None, then "NewA" is used.

    scheme     : The inner weighting scheme to use in the algorithm. The
                 scheme may be "Horst", "Centroid" or "Factorial". If
                 scheme = None, then Horst's schme is used (the inner
                 weighting scheme is the identity).

    max_iter   : The number of iteration before the algorithm is forced
                 to stop. The default number of iterations is 500.

    tolerance  : The level below which we treat numbers as zero. This is
                 used as stop criterion in the algorithm. Smaller value
                 will give more acurate results, but will take longer
                 time to compute. The default tolerance is 5E-07.

    not_normed : In some algorithms, e.g. PLS regression, the weights or
                 loadings of some matrices (e.g. Y) are not normalised.
                 This tuple or list contains the indices in X of those
                 matrices that should not be normalised. Thus, for PLS
                 regression, this argument would be not_normed = (2,). If
                 not_normed = None, then all matrices are subject to
                 normalisation of either weights or scores depending on
                 the modes used.
