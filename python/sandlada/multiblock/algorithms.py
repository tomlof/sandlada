"""
The :mod:`sandlada.multiblock.Algorithms` module includes several projection
based latent variable algorithms.

These algorithms all have in common that they maximise a criteria on the form

    f(w_1, ..., w_n) = \sum_{i,j=1}^n c_{i,j} g(cov(X_iw_i, X_jw_j)),

with possibly very different constraints put on the weights w_i or on the
scores t_i = X_iw_i (e.g. unit 2-norm of weights, unit variance of scores,
L1/LASSO constraint on the weights etc.).

This includes methods such as PCA (f(p) = cov(Xp, Xp)),
PLS-R (f(w, c) = cov(Xw, Yc)), PLS-PM (the criteria above), RGCCA (the
criteria above), etc.
