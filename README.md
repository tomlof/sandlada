Machine Learning sandbox

Sandlåda contains both R and python developement codes for general Machine Learning, not specific to an application domain (neuroimaging, genetic, etc.).

The python directory should be compliant with scikit-learn, in a way such that stable and generic code could be pushed to the scikit-learn repository.
