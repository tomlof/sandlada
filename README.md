Machine Learning sandbox

Sandlada contains both R and python developpement codes for general Machine Learning, not specific to an application domain (neuroimaging, genetic, etc.)

The python directory should be compliant with scikit-learn, in the way that stable and generic code could be pushed to the scikit-learn repository.
